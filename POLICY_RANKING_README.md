# Policy Ranking System

## Overview

The Policy Ranking System is a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing AI and policy documents based on three key dimensions: **Transparency**, **Explainability**, and **Accountability**. This system provides quantitative scoring and beautiful visualizations to help understand how different policies measure up against international standards.

## Key Features

### üèÜ Three-Dimensional Evaluation Framework

#### 1. Transparency Score (0-10)
**Definition**: Measures how open the policy is about its processes, decisions, data, and goals.

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Is the full policy document publicly accessible? (0-2 points)
- Does the policy clearly list the stakeholders involved in its creation? (0-2 points)
- Was there public consultation or feedback collected? (0-2 points)
- Does the policy provide open data or reporting on implementation? (0-2 points)
- Are decision-making criteria or algorithms disclosed? (0-2 points)

#### 2. Explainability Score (0-10)
**Definition**: Measures how understandable the AI systems and decisions are to users and stakeholders.

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Does the policy require systems to provide human-interpretable outputs? (0-2 points)
- Are explanations tailored to the audience (technical/non-technical)? (0-2 points)
- Are the decision-making processes (e.g., risk assessments) documented? (0-2 points)
- Are users informed about how AI decisions are made? (0-2 points)
- Does the policy include guidance for explainability in deployment? (0-2 points)

#### 3. Accountability Score (0-10)
**Definition**: Evaluates whether clear responsibilities, liabilities, and redress mechanisms are defined.

**Evaluation Questions**:
- Does the policy assign responsibility for AI decisions or harm? (0-2 points)
- Are there auditing or oversight mechanisms in place? (0-2 points)
- Can individuals seek redress or appeal AI decisions? (0-2 points)
- Is liability for misuse or errors clearly outlined? (0-2 points)
- Is there a governing/regulatory body identified? (0-2 points)

### üìä Scoring System

**Point Allocation**:
- **2 points**: Yes/Fully compliant
- **1 point**: Partial compliance/Limited implementation
- **0 points**: No compliance/Not addressed

**Total Score**: Maximum 30 points (10 points per dimension)
