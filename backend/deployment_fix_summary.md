# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
The Render deployment was failing with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'httpx'
```

## Root Cause
The enhanced chatbot service (`chatbot_service_enhanced.py`) uses `httpx` for making HTTP requests to the OpenAI/GPT API, but this dependency was missing from the production requirements.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated requirements.txt
Added:
```
httpx>=0.24.0,<0.27.0
```

### 2. Updated pyproject.toml
Added:
```
httpx = "^0.25.0"
```

### 3. Verified Configuration
- ✅ OpenAI API key properly configured in .env
- ✅ All imports working locally
- ✅ Enhanced chatbot service loads successfully

## Files Modified
- `requirements.txt` - Added httpx dependency
- `pyproject.toml` - Added httpx dependency for Poetry
- `test_deployment.py` - Created verification script

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Trigger new deployment on Render
3. Verify enhanced chatbot works in production
